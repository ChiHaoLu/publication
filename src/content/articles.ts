    "markdown": "\n# Understanding TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.\n\n## What is TypeScript?\n\nTypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Static Typing**: Catch errors before runtime\n- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced code completion and refactoring\n- **Object-Oriented Features**: Classes, interfaces, and inheritance\n- **Type Inference**: Automatic type detection\n\n## Basic Example\n\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\nfunction greet(user: User): string {\n  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTypeScript helps you write more maintainable and scalable code by adding type safety to JavaScript.\n",
