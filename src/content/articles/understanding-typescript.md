# Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript.

## Key Benefits

- **Static Typing**: Catch errors before runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced code completion and refactoring
- **Object-Oriented Features**: Classes, interfaces, and inheritance
- **Type Inference**: Automatic type detection

## Basic Example

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript helps you write more maintainable and scalable code by adding type safety to JavaScript.
